The study aims to develop robust machine learning-based QSAR (Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship) models for predicting the biological activity of compounds targeting prostate cancer.
	•	It involves the integration of molecular descriptors and molecular fingerprints to comprehensively represent chemical structure and properties.
	•	The modeling strategy employs ensemble learning techniques to enhance prediction performance and generalizability.
	•	Key objectives include:
	•	Identifying structural features that significantly influence anticancer activity.
	•	Improving predictive accuracy through model optimization and validation.
	•	Facilitating virtual screening of chemical libraries to discover promising therapeutic candidates.
